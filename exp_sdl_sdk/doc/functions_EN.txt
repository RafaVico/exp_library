FUNCTIONS USED BY EXP_SDL LIBRARY.

The exp_sdl library is used exclusively to display messages and notifications
from exp_core. For this, it makes use of the SDL and SDL_ttf libraries.


void exp_screen (SDL_Surface * screen);

We assign the SDL surface "screen" in which we will show the messages. It is usually the
Screen surface of the game.


void exp_osd (int value);

With this function we can indicate if we want messages to be displayed on the screen
from the bookstore. If "value" is 0 they will not be displayed, and if it is 1 they will be displayed. Default,
the messages are displayed on the screen.


void exp_update ();

This function is responsible for actually "drawing" the message, with the times
adequate. It is usually placed just before SDL_Flip (), so that when doing the
drawn show the messages you have stored. If you do not have any, it does not
nothing.


void exp_end ();

Function called when leaving the game. Free memory, etc ...


void exp_callback (int id, int value, char * name, char * desc);

This is the function that receives messages from exp_core and saves them in a list
internal These messages will be displayed in due time thanks to exp_update ().
The parameters that it receives are "id", the code of the experience. "value" the value
of the experience. "name" the name of the experience. "desc" the description of the
experience.
